## Basic Operations

Here you can view my programming laboratories and experiments coding in Data Science field with Python; starting from some [basic operations](https://github.com/LorenzoNegri/Python-Labs/tree/master/Basics) but still interesting coding, to some **advanced** hacking, tricks and tips on [data science fundamentals](https://lorenzonegri.github.io/Python-Labs/) coding with python.

The list of topics:
 - [Basic Operations](https://github.com/LorenzoNegri/Python-Labs/tree/master/Basics): Notes, Experiments and Discovering new things.
 - [Analyzing Data with Python](https://github.com/LorenzoNegri/Python-Labs/tree/master/Analyzing%20Data%20with%20Python): From simple to Pro.
 - [Visiualizing Data with Python](https://lorenzonegri.github.io/Python-Labs/): .
 - [Data Science Fundamentals](https://lorenzonegri.github.io/Python-Labs/): From simple to Pro.

Next, below, I showcase some coding of what you can find the links above.
